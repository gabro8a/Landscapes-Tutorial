# Landscapes-Tutorial
Tutorial on Search Landscapes Analysis and Visualisation.

Presented by Prof. Gabriela Ochoa at the
Summer School on Automatic Algorithm Design 2023 ([SSAAD 2023](https://ssaad2023.sciencesconf.org/))
12-16 Jun 2023 Villeneuve d'Ascq (France)

## Structure

The tutorial is structured into four parts:
1. Introduction to Fitness Landscapes ([part1_landscapes.pdf](handouts/part1_landscapes.pdf))
2. Introduction to complex networks ([part2_networks.pdf](handouts/part2_networks.pdf))
3. Local optima networks (LONs) ([part3_lons.pdf](handouts/part3_lons.pdf))

4. Search Trajectory networks (STNs) ([part4_stns.pdf](handouts/part4_stns.pdf))

## Practical Lab
Across the tutorial, we will discuss two case studies on landscape analysis and local optima networks. I have created separate repositories for these case studies with a general description, data and source code, and suggested exercises.

* Number Partitioning Problem (NPP) - [NPP-Landscapes](https://github.com/gabro8a/NPP-Landscapes)
